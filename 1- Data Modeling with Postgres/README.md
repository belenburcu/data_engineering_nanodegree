# Project: Data Modeling ETL with Postgres

### About The Project
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

### Description
In this project, I created a database schema, and data modeling with Postgres and ETL pipeline using Python for this analysis. To complete the project, it needed to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL. It can test the database and ETL pipeline by running queries given by the analytics team from Sparkify and comparing results with their expected results.
